These terms include: what is the price Amazon should pay to the vendor for a given unit of a product? Can we get vendor to provide funding for initiatives on Amazon (e.g. volume-based incentives, promotions / merchandising opportunities on our website)? How do we handle the cost of bringing in the product / cover any damage to the products? Do we have alternative sourcing channels (e.g. two or more vendors offering the same product) so we can negotiate harder? Each of these negotiation decisions has a direct impact on Amazon’s profitability.Now imagine doing this across tens of thousands of suppliers and tens of millions of products, across tens of different countries worldwide, and at a double-digit growth rate every year. Clearly it is not a problem we can solve with humans because we won’t be able to scale. Instead of relying on humans to make the final call, we will have machines make the actual decisions, so it is completely ‘hands off the wheels’ from humans.How do we do that? The good thing is we have data. Tons of them – historical contracts, product costs and historical supplier funding, sales performance etc. We will leverage this advantage to solve the problem using algorithms, machine learning and data-driven approaches.

We embrace leaders with a startup mentality -- those who seek a disruptive yet clear mission and purpose, have an unambiguous owner mindset, and are relentlessly obsessed with making connections with customers.As a Software Development Manager, you will assemble and lead a team of engineers to solve challenging technical and business problems. You will be pioneering within a multi-dimensional optimization space which requires you to balance the interests of advertisers, shoppers, and Amazon. Innovation is a key area of focus for you because you will not be applying technology to improve the product -- technology IS the product. You will drive technical strategy and architecture at both the infrastructure and application tiers. Your experience in leadership and coaching will help you grow the individuals within your team and foster a transparent, collaborative development environment.In this role, you will be responsible for innovating on the engineering systems that implement models and workflows to improve precision and recall of the sourcing systems, which fetch advertisements for billions of detail page requests each day. You will invent new features to improve our state-of-the-art information processing systems. You will also deep-dive on specific vertical categories, for example, to help customers shop for groceries, make purchases for their business, select apparel or choose e-books. Typical projects include testing new ways to match existing advertisement inventory with incoming product page requests, incorporating new data sets and features into the existing ad-sourcing algorithms.The Sponsored Products advertisement index captures all advertiser changes in near real-time so that the advertisements are utilized effectively in the ads server. You will collaborate with Machine Learning, NLP scientists and principal engineers within the team and across disciplines as part of your daily job. You will design and build large scale and low latency infrastructure to serve advertisements based on deep-learning and other advanced machine learning approaches.You are:§ Highly analytical and data-driven: You solve problems in ways that are backed up with data. You focus on driving processes, tools, and statistical methods which support rational decision-making.§ Technically fearless: You are not satisfied by performing 'as expected' and push the limits past conventional boundaries. Your dial goes to '11'.§ Team obsessed: You find and cultivate talent to be capable of achieving outstanding results. You help develop the creative atmosphere to let engineers innovate, while holding them accountable for making smart decisions and delivering results.§ Humbitious: You are ambitious, yet humble. You recognize that there is always opportunity for improvement and use introspection and feedback from teammates and peers to raise the bar for your team.§ Ambigu-capable: You are able to explore new problem spaces with unique constraints and thus non-obvious solutions; you are quick to identify any gaps in the team and the right person to fill them to best deliver value to customersYou will:§ Own technical vision and direction: You identify and mitigate risks, construct project schedules, and prepare status reports; you embrace performance metrics and measurement techniques because they help you assess how well system-related services are running.§ Build and grow your team: You will be accountable for building an engineering team that delivers results. This means you will wear a lot of hats -- from coaching individuals, to leading technical discussions, recruiting, establishing processes, and so on. You will be an example of Amazon's leadership principles and work to grow more leaders within your group.§ Collaborate on product direction: You will build and maintain strong relationships between engineering and partner disciplines (Applied Science, Product, User Experience, QA) to ensure that we are focused on delivering the right product for customers.§ Lead beyond your team: You will be a key part of a small but growing community of engineering leaders who support their teams and contribute to the overall growth of our product development organization. You will share your best practices and technical acumen in order to drive technology decisions across our organization.§ Own your own shop: Our products reach hundreds of millions of customers around the world. We run operations 24x7x365 and the services your team delivers must meet high standards for operational excellence.

We build, maintain and vend base map data, road network data, map tiles, geocodes of addresses and time estimates for service as well as transit times. We also provide a shortest path service to find fastest paths between locations and a service to optimize consolidation of stops. Together these systems help us get better at determining the locations that we go to deliver packages, figure out how to get to those locations and to estimate the effort of delivery for planning.While it may be easy to say “Why build yet another Maps?” as a first reaction, as we go deeper into our problems, the answer becomes increasingly clear and challenging. We are building systems that enable depth focused solutions. For example, we are interested in not only getting a person to an address like 300 Boren Ave N, we are also interested in helping them find out if there is a mailing room in the building and if there is, helping them navigate quickly to that mailing room. We are also interested in accurately estimating how long it would take to arrive at the address, find the mailing room and drop a package there. We will incorporate the ability to leverage mass transit, multiple modes of transportation and traffic awareness to find the most efficient paths for our drivers. We are also interested in making it easy to calculate paths on cheap mobile devices or in simplifying the process to find an efficient path to cover hundreds of delivery points. Several of these problems require us in building systems that can work with an ensemble of models as well as support the right segmentation of inputs to make good estimates on the outputs.There are several unsolved or partially solved problems in this space such as automatically adding new roads detected from sensor/video data into the larger road graph, deterministically detecting if a new road is in fact just a modification to an existing road (such as a change in curvature of an existing road due to a new sidewalk), accurately determining the bearing of a person when they start traveling leveraging only a single and single IMU sensor source, parsing unstructured addresses such as in countries like India, processing alternate solutions within microseconds on a mobile device without talking to a backend service and so on. The right person for this space would enjoy working in a space that requires constantly pushing both the research and -off edges to unlock solutions to such problems.The person would be building multiple ML / AI based solution and build optimized solution which can traverse over a complex graph of billions of nodes and edges.Our key output metrics include location accuracy, coverage and accuracy of our road network for routing and users to the correct location, predictive accuracy of service and transit estimates. We also measure the operational impact of these inputs on delivery success and on the gaps between actual versus planned on-zone times, transit times and service times.Key Responsibilities:· Participate in the design, implementation, and deployment of successful large-scale systems and services in support of our fulfillment operations and the businesses they support.· Participate in the definition of secure, scalable, and low-latency services and efficient physical processes.· Work in expert cross-functional teams delivering on demanding projects.· Functionally decompose complex problems into simple, straight-forward solutions.· Understand system interdependencies and limitations.· Share knowledge in performance, scalability, enterprise system architecture, and engineering best practices.If you have an entrepreneurial spirit, know how to deliver, are deeply technical, highly innovative and long for the opportunity to build pioneering solutions to challenging problems, we want to talk to you.","· Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science or related field.· 5+ years experience in a related field· Demonstrated proficiency with Java, C++, or equivalent object-oriented programming language.· Strong problem solving and analytical abilities.· Understanding of algorithmic design and complexity analysis.· Strong verbal and written communication skills and an ability to work in a team environment.· High sense of ownership, self-motivation, and desire to delight customers.","· Experience in large-scale maps, location, and geographic technology· Experience developing cloud software services and an understanding of design for scalability, performance and reliability.· Development experience defining, developing and maintaining REST based interfaces· Excellence in technical communication with peers and non-technical cohorts who may be remote· Solid knowledge of software development methodologies and best practices.· Ability to tackle big, incompletely-specified problems and resolve ambiguity in the customer's favor.· Experience defining system architectures and designs, exploring technical feasibility tradeoffs, and making data-driven decisions.· Demonstrated ability to mentor other software developers to develop all aspects of their engineering skill sets.· Ability to drive consensus within a team and influence outcomes in significant technical decision-making.· Experience interviewing and evaluating potential software engineer new hires.#lastmileAmazon is an Equal Opportunity-Affirmative Action Employer - Female/Minority/Disability/Veteran/Gender Identity/Sexual Orientation",Last Mile
